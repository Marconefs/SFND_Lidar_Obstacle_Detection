Plane segmentation with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus): ransac3d.cpp

RANSAC runs for a max number of iterations, and returns the model with the best fit. 
Each iteration randomly picks a subsample of the data and fits a model through it, 
such as a line or a plane. Then the iteration with the highest number of inliers or the 
lowest noise is used as the best model.

Euclidean clustering: cluster.cpp
uses KD-Tree for searching points during clustering task: kdtree.h 
A KD-Tree is a binary tree that splits points between alternating axes.

Find Bounding boxes with principal component analysis (PCA) including Z axis rotations.
